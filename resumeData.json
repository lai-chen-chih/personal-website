    "aboutMe": "I am a fourth-year PhD student at the UBC Math Department studying partial differential equations, with a particular focus on fluid dynamics, under the supervision of Prof. Tai-Peng Tsai and Prof. Juncheng Wei. Previously I worked at National Center for Theoretical Science (NCTS) as a research assistant under the supervision of Prof. Chun-Hsiung Hsia, and was working on reaction-diffusion equations and synchronization problems. Before that, I completed my M.Sc. in Mathematics at National Taiwan University (NTU) under the supervision of Prof. Chun-Hsiung Hsia, and was researching on population estimates for traveling waves of Lotka–Voterra system.",
