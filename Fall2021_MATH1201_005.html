<h1>MATH UN1201 (Section 005): Calculus III, Fall 2021</h1>

<hr>

<h3>Announcement</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Welcome to Calculus III (Section 005)! This is a one-semester course in multivariable differential calculus.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Course Information</h3>

<p><b>Topics: </b>Vectors and the geometry of space, vector functions, functions of several variables and partial derivatives</p>
<p><b>Prerequisites: </b>Math UN1101: Calculus I or an equivalent. For more information on calculus: <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/programs-math/undergraduate-program/calculus-classes/">http://www.math.columbia.edu/programs-math/undergraduate-program/calculus-classes/ </a> </a></a></p>
<p><b>Instructor: </b>Chen-Chih Lai<br>
&emsp;&emsp; <b>Email: </b>cl4205 at columbia dot edu<br>
&emsp;&emsp; <b>Office: </b>307A Mathematics Building<br>
&emsp;&emsp; Office hours provide you with opportunities to ask questions about course material or mathematics in general.<br>
&emsp;&emsp; <b>Office Hours: </b>Tue, Wed 1:10pm–2:25pm via <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/4217173764?pwd=ODZtMkk0SVZTdHNZNEpoWnJTRlBzUT09">Zoom</a>, or by appointment (in-person or via Zoom)</p>
<p><b>Teaching assistant(s): </b>TBA</p>
<p><b>Textbook: </b><em>Calculus: Early Transcendentals, </em><b>8th Edition, </b>by James Stewart</p>
<p><b>Grading: </b>Homework (30%), Midterm 1 (20%), Midterm 2 (20%), Final Exam (30%).<br>
There will be no makeup exams under any circumstances. However, the lowest score of the two midterms will be replaced by the final exam score if this increases your total score. So you can miss one midterm without too much damage. On the other hand, missing both midterms or missing the final will seriously harm your grade. Please check the exam dates now (see below) to make sure that you have no unavoidable conflicts!</p>

    <li>Late homework will not be accepted under any circumstances. If you have a medical circumstance that prevents you from turning in homework, you will need a doctor's note to receive an extension.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Exams</h3>
<ul>
    <li>There will be <b>two midterm tests</b> and <b>one cumulative final exam</b>.</li>
    <li>The midterm tests will be taken <b>during class time</b>. The topics covered by each of the two tests will be announced in class and posted on the course website. If you are unable to take one of the midterms at the scheduled time, please let me know as soon as possible so that we can figure out a solution.</li>
    <li>The final exam is <b>provisionally</b> scheduled by the University. The final exam is cumulative and covers all the material discussed during the semester.</li>
    <li>You may use a formula sheet during the exams, no longer than two sides of an A4 page.</li>
    <li>The only electronic device you may use is a calculator (e.g. scientific calculator), but programmable or graphing calculators are not allowed.</li>
