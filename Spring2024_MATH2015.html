<h1>MATH UN2015: Linear Algebra and Probability, Spring 2024</h1>

<hr>

<h3>Announcement</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>May 1</b>: Final exam is converted into a take-home assignment, which is now available on Gradescope and due <b>Monday, May 6, at 4pm</b>.<br>
        The grading scheme is adjusted with the following two options:<br>
        <ul>
        <li>HW: 25% (with the 2 lowest grades dropped), Midterm 1: 15%, Midterm 2: 15%, Project: 15%, Final Exam: 30%</li>
        <li>HW: 40% (with the lowest grade dropped), Midterm 1: 20%, Midterm 2: 20%, Project: 20%, Final Exam: 0%</li>
        </ul>
        Your final grade will be automatically calculated based on the option that yields the highest result for you.<br>
        Although the Final exam is now optional, I strongly encourage you to still consider taking it. It presents a valuable opportunity to assess your comprehension and application of the course material.
    </li>
    <li><b>Apr 22</b>: Today's class will be held <b>virtually</b>. As for the presentation session on this Wednesday Apr 24, it is going to be <b>hybrid</b>.</li>
    <li>Welcome to Linear Algebra and Probability! This is a one-semester course features linear algebra and probability with a focus on applications and the practical approach to problem solving.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<ul>
    <li>There will be 11 weekly homework assignments assigned throughout the term.</li>
    <li>Homework will be posted on <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>. Please submit your homework on <a href="https://www.gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>.</li>
    <li>Collaboration and discussion with your classmates is encouraged, but I encourage you to attempt the problems on your own before you discuss them with classmates, and you must write up assignments individually.</li>
    <li>Make sure the writing in your submission is clear enough to the reader.</li>
    <li>The lowest homework grade will be dropped.</li>
    <li>Late homework will not be accepted under any circumstances. If you have a medical circumstance that prevents you from turning in homework, you will need a doctor's note to receive an extension.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>Project</h3>
<ur>
    <li>You will be working on a capstone applied project, which is to be completed in small groups (up to 5 students).</li>
    <li>The capstone project includes a written report and a 5-minute presentation.</li>
    <li>You can work on the applied project at your own pace. Your written reports are due no later than <b>Friday, April 19</b>. The 5-minute presentations are scheduled on <b>Wednesday, April 24</b> and <b>Monday, April 29</b>.</li>

</ur>

<hr>

<h3>Exams</h3>
<ul>
    <li>There will be <b>two midterm tests</b> and <b>one cumulative final exam</b>.</li>

If you are unable to take one of the midterms at the scheduled time, please let me know as soon as possible so that we can figure out a solution.</li>
    <li>There will be no makeup exams under any circumstances. Please check the exam dates now (see below) to make sure that you have no unavoidable conflicts! If you are unable to take one of the midterms at the scheduled time, please let me know as soon as possible so that we can figure out a solution. </li>
    <li>The final exam is <b>provisionally</b> scheduled by the University. The final exam is cumulative and covers all the material discussed during the semester.</li>
    <li>You may use a formula sheet during the exams, no longer than two sides of an A4 page.</li>
    <li>Calculators, mobile phones, computers or any other devices are not allowed on exams.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Academic Accommodation of Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; <a href="https://health.columbia.edu/content/disability-services">Disability Services</a> facilitates equal access for students with disabilities by coordinating accommodations and support services, and cultivating a campus culture that is sensitive and responsive to the needs of students.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations, CC and GS students must first be registered with <a href="https://health.columbia.edu/content/disability-services">Disability Services (DS)</a>. More information on the DS registration process is available online at <a href="https://health.columbia.edu/ods">https://health.columbia.edu/ods</a>.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; Faculty must be notified of registered students' accommodations before exams or other accommodations will be provided. Students who have, or think they may have, a disability are invited to contact Disability Services for a confidential discussion at (212) 854-2388 (Voice/TTY) or by email at <a href="mailto:disability@columbia.edu">disability@columbia.edu</a>. Barnard students are invited to visit the <a href="https://barnard.edu/disabilityservices/students">Center for Accessibility Resources & Disability Services (CARDS)</a>.</p>
