<h3>Homework</h3>
<ul>
    <li>There will biweekly homework assignments.</li>
    <li>Collaboration and discussion with your classmates is encouraged, but I encourage you to attempt the problems on your own before you discuss them with classmates, and you must write up assignments individually.</li>
    <li>Make sure the writing in your submission is clear enough to the reader.</li>
    <li>The lowest homework grade will be dropped.</li>
    <li>Late homework will not be accepted under any circumstances. If you have a medical circumstance that prevents you from turning in homework, you will need a doctor's note to receive an extension.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Exams</h3>
<ul>
    <li>There will be <b>two midterm tests</b> and <b>one cumulative final exam</b>.</li>
    <li>The midterm tests will be taken <b>during class time</b>. The topics covered by each of the two tests will be announced in class and posted on the course website. If you are unable to take one of the midterms at the scheduled time, please let me know as soon as possible so that we can figure out a solution.</li>
    <li>The final exam is <b>provisionally</b> scheduled by the University. The final exam is cumulative and covers all the material discussed during the semester.</li>
    <li>Calculators, mobilde phones, computers or any other devices are not allows on exams.</li>

<h3>Academic Accommodation of Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; <a href="https://health.columbia.edu/content/disability-services">Disability Services</a> facilitates equal access for students with disabilities by coordinating accommodations and support services, and cultivating a campus culture that is sensitive and responsive to the needs of students.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations, CC and GS students must first be registered with <a href="https://health.columbia.edu/content/disability-services">Disability Services (DS)</a>. More information on the DS registration process is available online at <a href="https://health.columbia.edu/ods">https://health.columbia.edu/ods</a>.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; Faculty must be notified of registered students' accommodations before exams or other accommodations will be provided. Students who have, or think they may have, a disability are invited to contact Disability Services for a confidential discussion at (212) 854-2388 (Voice/TTY) or by email at <a href="mailto:disability@columbia.edu">disability@columbia.edu</a>. Barnard students are invited to visit the <a href="https://barnard.edu/disabilityservices/students">Center for Accessibility Resources & Disability Services (CARDS)</a>.</p>
