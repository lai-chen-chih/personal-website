&emsp;&emsp; <b>Office: </b>307A Mathematics Building<br>
&emsp;&emsp; Office hours provide you with opportunities to ask questions about course material or mathematics in general.<br>
&emsp;&emsp; <b>Office Hours: </b>Tue 2:40pm–3:55pm and Wed 10:10am–11:25am, or <a href="mailto:cl4205@math.columbia.edu">by appointment</a> (in-person or via Zoom)

<p><b>Teaching assistant(s): TBA</b><br>
    Graduate TA: Roy Magen (Help room hours: Tue 2pm–4pm, Thu 3pm–5pm, Friday 4pm–6pm in 502 Milstein at Barnard Campus)<br>
    Undergraduate TA: Young Wang (Help room hours: Thu 2pm–4pm in 502 Milstein at Barnard Campus)    
    </p>
<p><b>Textbook: </b><em>Calculus: Early Transcendentals, </em><b>9th Edition, </b>by James Stewart</p>
<p><b>Grading: </b>Homework (30%), Midterm 1 (20%), Midterm 2 (20%), Final Exam (30%).<br>
There will be no makeup exams under any circumstances. However, the lowest score of the two midterms will be replaced by the final exam score if this increases your total score. So you can miss one midterm without too much damage. On the other hand, missing both midterms or missing the final will seriously harm your grade. Please check the exam dates now (see below) to make sure that you have no unavoidable conflicts!</p>

<h3>Academic Accommodation of Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; <a href="https://health.columbia.edu/content/disability-services">Disability Services</a> facilitates equal access for students with disabilities by coordinating accommodations and support services, and cultivating a campus culture that is sensitive and responsive to the needs of students.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations, CC and GS students must first be registered with <a href="https://health.columbia.edu/content/disability-services">Disability Services (DS)</a>. More information on the DS registration process is available online at <a href="https://health.columbia.edu/ods">https://health.columbia.edu/ods</a>.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp; Faculty must be notified of registered students' accommodations before exams or other accommodations will be provided. Students who have, or think they may have, a disability are invited to contact Disability Services for a confidential discussion at (212) 854-2388 (Voice/TTY) or by email at <a href="mailto:disability@columbia.edu">disability@columbia.edu</a>. Barnard students are invited to visit the <a href="https://barnard.edu/disabilityservices/students">Center for Accessibility Resources & Disability Services (CARDS)</a>.</p>
